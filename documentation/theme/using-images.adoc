= Using images

Place images and other static assets, which need to be accessibly by the browser, in the `/src/main/webapp/` folder and use absolute paths in CSS for those assets. For Spring-based projects use `/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/`.

For a comprehensive documentation how static resources are handled, see <<../importing-dependencies/tutorial-ways-of-importing#,Storing and Loading Resources>>

== Example

Given the following file/folder structure:

* `/src/main/webapp/img/logo.png`

Referencing the image from a style sheet (see <<including-style-sheets#,Including style sheets>> to learn how to include custom style sheets to your app):

[source,css]
....
.logo {
  background-image: url(/img/logo.png);
}
....
