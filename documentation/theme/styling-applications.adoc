= Styling Applications

Learn how to apply app-specific styling across your custom views and components and how to use images and icons.

=== Prerequisites

You should be familiar with <<including-style-sheets#,including style sheets>> to the different <<style-scopes#,style scopes>> in your app.

== Styling Views and Components

Your app specific views and components are usually built by composing existing lower-level components.
Styling these components is a little different from <<styling-vaadin-components#,styling the internals of built-in Vaadin components>>.

=== Server-side Views

Java-based views and components (extending from `Component`) are rendered in the global scope.
You can apply traditional CSS styling techniques for them.

The most common technique is to add CSS classes to the components in the view and target those classes in your style sheets.

.`MyView.java`
[source,java]
----
@CssImport("./styles/my-view.css")
class MyView extends VerticalLayout {
  public MyView() {
    addClassName("my-view");

    H1 heading = new H1("My View Title");
    heading.addClassName("heading");

    Paragraph text = new Paragraph("Thanks for stopping by. Not much to see here. Click the button below to go back to start.");

    Button backButton = new Button("Go Back");
    backButton.addClassName("back-button");

    add(heading, text, backButton);
  }
}
----

.`styles/my-view.css`
[source,css]
----
.heading {
  margin-top: 0;
}

p {
  /* Assuming we are using the Lumo theme. If not, fall back to 1.2em */
  font-size: var(--lumo-font-size-l, 1.2em);
}

.back-button {
  background-color: var(--lumo-shade-90pct);
}
----

The <<client-side,instructions for client-side views and components>> apply to template-based views and components (i.e. extending `PolymerTemplate`).


=== Client-side Views

Client-side views and components are usually authored using Polymer, extending `PolymerElement`.
Polymer elements render their HTML template inside shadow DOM and create a new style scope.

The instructions in <<../polymer-templates/styling-polymer-templates#,Styling Polymer Templates>> apply to client-side views.

If you wish to author your client-side views using some other technology (for example https://lit-element.polymer-project.org[LitElement]), refer to the styling instructions for that technology.

== Using Images and Fonts

Images, web fonts, and other static assets, which need to be accessible by the browser, should be placed in the `/src/main/webapp/` folder.
For _Spring Boot -based projects_ use `/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/`.

See <<../importing-dependencies/tutorial-ways-of-importing#,Storing and Loading Resources>> for a comprehensive documentation how static resources are handled.

=== Server-side

TODO the Image component

=== Client-side

Use absolute paths in your HTM and CSS for static assets.

=== Example

If you have an image in `/src/main/webapp/img/logo.png`, you can re reference it from a style sheet (see <<including-style-sheets#,Including style sheets>>) as shown below:

[source,css]
----
.logo {
  background-image: url"(/img/logo.png");
}
----


== Using Icons

In general, icons are not different from images, as they show a graphic on the page. For bitmap-based icons (JPG, PNG, WebP, etc.) you s

Since icons have some addition requirements, such as the need to be able to change their size and color using CSS, they are usually created using the SVG vector format and embedded directly inside the resulting HTML, instead of being referenced via CSS `background-image: url(icon.svg)` or HTML `<img src="icon.svg">`.

Vaadin has a component specifically for showing SVG icons. In addition, Vaadin offers a large https://vaadin.com/components/vaadin-icons/[collection of icons] for you to use (with both SVG and font formats).
