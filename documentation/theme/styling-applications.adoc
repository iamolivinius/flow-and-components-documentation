= Styling Applications

Learn how to apply app-specific styling across your custom app views and components and how to use images and icons.

=== Prerequisites

You should be familiar with <<including-style-sheets#,including style sheets>> to the different <<style-scopes#,style scopes>> in your app.

===== Contents

* <<styling-views-and-components>>
* <<using-images>>
* <<using-icons>>

== Styling Views and Components

Your app specific views and components are usually built by composing existing, lower-level components. Styling these components is a little different from <<styling-vaadin-components#,styling the built-in Vaadin components>>.

=== Server-side

Java-based views and components (extending from `Component`) are rendered in the global scope. You can apply traditional CSS styling techniques for your Java-based views.

The <<client-side,instructions for client-side views and components>> apply for template-based views and components (i.e. extending `PolymerTemplate`).


=== Client-side

Client-side views and components are usually authored using Polymer (extending `Polymer.Element`). Polymer elements render their HTML template inside shadow DOM and create a new style scope.



== Using Images

Place images and other static assets, which need to be accessibly by the browser, in the `/src/main/webapp/` folder and use absolute paths in CSS for those assets. For Spring-based projects use `/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/`.

For a comprehensive documentation how static resources are handled, see <<../importing-dependencies/tutorial-ways-of-importing#,Storing and Loading Resources>>

=== Example

Given the following file/folder structure:

* `/src/main/webapp/img/logo.png`

Referencing the image from a style sheet (see <<including-style-sheets#,Including style sheets>> to learn how to include custom style sheets to your app):

[source,css]
----
.logo {
  background-image: url(/img/logo.png);
}

== Using Icons

=== Server-side

TODO the Icon component, VaadinIcons and LumoIcons, and how to build your own iconset

=== Client-side

TODO <iron-icon>, vaadin-icons and lumo-icons, and how to build your own iconset
